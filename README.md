This project shows the parameter identification algorithm I settled during my scientific period.

Experimental data indicates non-inactivated ionic currents (from nervous system), sometime consist of two components which are impossible to pharmacologically isolate. Also, an algorithm from engineering field has been shown to be efficient in parameters identification of sodium ionic currents.

So, using simulated data I have shown that this algorithm is also able to identify the parameters of two populations of non-inactivated ionic channels more accurately than a classical method. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the algorithm is insensitive to the key parameter variations.
